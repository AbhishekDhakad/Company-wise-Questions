12) Given an array of integers(+ve,-ve and 0) find the sign of the product of all the given values.
13) Given an integer(+ve or -ve) consisting of at least one 5 in its digits(can have more than one 5). Return the maximum value by deleting exactly one 5 from its digit.
Ex: N = 1598 => result = 198(remove the only 5 from the sequence)
N = 150,958 => result = 15,098(we wanna return the maximum value 15,098 > 10,958)
N = -5859 => result = -589 ( -589>- 859)
14) Given an array N, return true if it is possible we can pair all the numbers in the array with equal values. E.g N = [1, 2, 2, 1] -> true as we can pair (N[0], N[3]) and (N[1], N[2]). N = [7, 7, 7] would return false.
15) find_min function is implemented wrongly (the function was implemented to always return 0), write a function to return a counter example array of size n that when passed to find_min will always return a wrong answer. E.g n = 4, [100, 500, 200, 300].
16) Given a string s, find the minimum number of substrings you can create without having the same letters repeating in each substring.
E.g world -> 5, as the string has no letters that occur more than once.
dddd -> 4, as you can only create substring of each character.
abba -> 2, as you can make substrings of ab, ba.
cycle-> 2, you can create substrings of (cy, cle) or (c, ycle)
